# PremiumRadar-SAAS - TC Context File

## CRITICAL PRODUCT MODEL (READ FIRST)

**PremiumRadar is NOT an industry-intelligence engine.**
**PremiumRadar IS a sales enablement platform for salespeople.**

### BANKING ONLY (For Now)

**Only the Banking vertical is currently active.** All other verticals (Insurance, Real Estate, Recruitment, SaaS Sales) are **UI placeholders only** with no backend intelligence logic.

---

## Active Vertical: Banking

### 1. VERTICAL = Salesperson's Sector
The sector in which the SALESPERSON works (not the target company's industry).

| Vertical | Status | Radar Target |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| **Banking** | ✅ ACTIVE | Companies |
| Insurance | 🔒 UI Placeholder | Individuals |
| Real Estate | 🔒 UI Placeholder | Families |
| Recruitment | 🔒 UI Placeholder | Candidates |
| SaaS Sales | 🔒 UI Placeholder | Companies |

### 2. SUB-VERTICAL = Salesperson's Role (Banking Only)
The specific function or product area within Banking:

| Sub-Vertical | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Employee Banking | Payroll, salary accounts, employee benefits |
| Corporate Banking | Treasury, trade finance, corporate loans |
| SME Banking | Small business accounts, working capital |

### 3. REGION = Salesperson's Operating Territory
Filters companies to the salesperson's territory:

| Level | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Country | UAE, India, US |
| City | Dubai, Chennai, Bangalore |
| Territory | Dubai South, DIFC, Whitefield |

---

## Signals: Sales Opportunity Triggers ONLY

### CRITICAL: What Signals ARE

Signals are **sales opportunity triggers from OS**, representing actionable company events that indicate banking needs:

| Signal Type | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `hiring-expansion` | Company hiring = needs payroll accounts |
| `headcount-jump` | Rapid growth = scaling banking needs |
| `office-opening` | New office = new corporate accounts |
| `market-entry` | Entering UAE = needs local bank |
| `funding-round` | Capital raised = treasury needs |
| `project-award` | New project = working capital needs |
| `subsidiary-creation` | New entity = multi-entity banking |

### CRITICAL: What Signals ARE NOT

PremiumRadar does **NOT** model:
- ❌ Life events (marriage, birth, retirement)
- ❌ Family events (new baby, family growth)
- ❌ Individual relocations
- ❌ Salary changes
- ❌ Rental expiry
- ❌ Tech adoption signals
- ❌ Industry intelligence / market analysis

These were **hallucinated in error** and have been removed.

## Vertical Config API

**Endpoint:** `/api/admin/vertical-config`

```typescript
// GET - Fetch Banking config (only one that works)
GET /api/admin/vertical-config?vertical=banking&subVertical=employee-banking&region=UAE

// Response for Banking
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "vertical": "banking",
    "subVertical": "employee-banking",
    "regionCountry": "UAE",
    "radarTarget": "companies",
    "config": {
      "allowedSignalTypes": ["hiring-expansion", "headcount-jump", ...],
      "scoringWeights": { "quality": 0.3, ... },
      "enrichmentSources": [...],
      "outreachChannels": [...],
      "journeyStages": [...]
    }
  }
}

// Response for NON-BANKING verticals
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "VERTICAL_NOT_CONFIGURED",
  "message": "Coming Soon — We're expanding to your industry! Request early access."
}
```

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Active & Working
- Banking vertical (ONLY)
- Employee Banking / Corporate Banking / SME Banking sub-verticals
- UAE region
- Sales trigger signals (hiring, expansion, funding, etc.)
- Scoring engine for banking
- Pattern matching for banking
- Deep persona for banking
- SIVA prompts for banking
- Dashboard components show "Coming Soon" for non-banking

### 🔒 UI Placeholders Only (No Backend Logic)
- Insurance vertical
- Real Estate vertical
- Recruitment vertical
- SaaS Sales vertical

### 🚧 To Build (Future)
- Super-Admin UI for vertical management
- Additional vertical implementations (when ready)

---

## DO NOT DO

1. ❌ Create backend intelligence for non-banking verticals
2. ❌ Add life event, family event, or relocation signals
3. ❌ Model insurance/real-estate/recruitment signals
4. ❌ Build industry-analysis features
5. ❌ Assume signals work across verticals
6. ❌ Hardcode vertical-specific logic in frontend

## DO

1. ✅ Only Banking has active intelligence
2. ✅ All signals are sales triggers from OS
3. ✅ Show "Coming Soon" for non-banking verticals
4. ✅ Keep SaaS plug-and-play ready for future verticals
5. ✅ Filter by salesperson's context (vertical/sub-vertical/region)

---

## Summary

> **PremiumRadar currently supports Banking salespeople only. Intelligence includes hiring expansion, office openings, funding rounds, and other company-level sales triggers. Other verticals (Insurance, Real Estate, Recruitment, SaaS) are UI placeholders that show "Coming Soon" messages.**

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active Vertical | Banking only |
| Radar Target | Companies |
| Signal Types | Sales triggers (hiring, expansion, funding) |
| Non-Banking | UI placeholders, "Coming Soon" |
| Source of Truth | OS config via API |

**Signals are sales triggers, NOT life events.**
**Banking only. Everything else is Coming Soon.**

## SIVA Multi-Vertical Architecture (APPROVED)

**Decision Date**: December 4, 2025
**Status**: FINAL ARCHITECTURE

### Core Principle

```
Vertical     = WHAT industry the salesperson works in
Sub-Vertical = WHO the salesperson is (their role)
Persona      = HOW the salesperson thinks (their brain)

Therefore: Persona MUST be stored per Sub-Vertical in Super Admin.
```

### Why Persona Per Sub-Vertical (Not Vertical)

| Vertical | Sub-Verticals (Each needs different persona!) |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Banking | Employee Banking, Corporate Banking, SME Banking |
| Insurance | Individual, Corporate, Health |
| Recruitment | Tech Talent, Executive Search |

**EB persona ⊥ Corporate Banking persona** — they are NOT interchangeable.

### Persona Controls Everything SIVA Does

- Edge Cases (blockers, boosters)
- Timing Rules (calendar, signal freshness)
- Contact Priority (who to target)
- Outreach Doctrine (always/never rules)
- Target Entity Type (company vs individual)
- Decision Chains (thresholds, logic)

### Architecture

```
Super Admin
└── Sub-Vertical
    ├── Config (signals, weights, thresholds)
    └── 🧠 Persona (per sub-vertical)
        ├── Identity & Mission
        ├── Edge Cases
        ├── Timing Rules
        ├── Contact Priority
        ├── Outreach Doctrine
        └── Anti-Patterns

UPR OS / SIVA
└── Loads persona dynamically: PersonaService.get(sub_vertical_id)
└── Tools use persona config (not hardcoded logic)
```

### Current State vs Target State

| Aspect | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Persona location | Hardcoded in `siva-brain-spec-v1.md` | DB per sub-vertical |
| Tools | Hardcoded EB logic | Load from `persona.{field}` |
| Multi-vertical | ❌ EB-only | ✅ Any sub-vertical |

## UPR OS Integration

### SIVA is NOT UPR OS

| Term | What It Is |
|------|------------|
| **UPR OS** | The operating system platform |
| **SIVA** | The intelligent agent INSIDE UPR OS |
| **Persona** | The brain configuration per sub-vertical |

### Active API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /api/os/score` | QTLE scoring |
| `POST /api/os/rank` | Profile-based ranking |
| `POST /api/agent-core/v1/tools/*` | Individual SIVA tools |

### Required Context for Every SIVA Call

```typescript
{
  vertical: "banking",
  sub_vertical: "employee_banking",
  region: "UAE"
}
```

SIVA loads persona from sub_vertical and applies all rules dynamically.
