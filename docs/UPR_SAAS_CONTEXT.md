---

## 4. Deployment Rules

### Staging Deployment (AUTOMATIC)

**Trigger:** Push to `main` branch

```bash
git push origin main
```

**CI/CD will:**
1. Build SaaS
2. Deploy to Cloud Run staging → `premiumradar-saas-staging`
3. Update domain → `upr.sivakumar.ai`
4. Post deployment log
5. TC runs `/start` to validate

✔ This environment is for Sprint development & testing
✔ Workers & OS auto-sync

### Production Deployment (MANUAL)

**Trigger:** Push to `production` branch

```bash
git checkout production
git merge main
git push origin production
```

**CI/CD will:**
1. Build SaaS
2. Deploy to Cloud Run production → `premiumradar-saas-production`
3. Update SLA domain → `premiumradar.com`
4. TC runs `/qa` to certify deployment
5. TC updates:
   - Release Notes
   - Knowledge page
   - Sprint DB (if applicable)

✔ Safe
✔ Zero-risk
✔ VC-ready governance

---

## 5. TC Operating Rules

### TC MUST:

- Load this file before executing anything
- Validate Notion schema before read/write
- Validate Cloud Run health before proceeding
- Update:
  - Sprint page
  - Features page
  - Knowledge page
- Create:
  - Sprint docs
  - QA docs
  - Batch docs

### TC MUST NOT:

- Auto-create sprints (without explicit founder request)
- Auto-create features (without explicit founder request)
- Modify OS v1
- Deploy to production without approval
- Assume any table/column name
- Assume any environment variables
- Run local commands
- Use local database

### Notion Sync Rules (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL:** TC must populate ALL required fields when updating Notion databases, not just status fields.

#### For Every Sprint Record, TC Must Populate:

- Status (select)
- Sprint Name (title)
- Goal (rich_text)
- Outcomes (rich_text)
- Highlights (rich_text)
- Business Value (rich_text)
- Started At (date)
- Completed At (date)
- Commit (rich_text)
- Git Tag (rich_text)
- Branch (rich_text)
- Phases Updated (multi_select)
- Learnings (rich_text)
- Commits Count (number)
- Synced At (date)

#### For Every Feature Record, TC Must Populate:

- Feature Name (title)
- Sprint (number)
- Status (select)
- Priority (select)
- Complexity (select)
- Type (select)
- Notes (rich_text)
- Tags (multi_select)
- Started At (date)
- Completed At (date)
- Assignee (rich_text)
- Done? (checkbox)

#### 9-Step Notion Sync Workflow:

When TC performs any Notion update, TC must follow this workflow:

1. **Fetch schema** - Retrieve full database schema
2. **Validate schema** - Ensure all required properties exist
3. **Detect missing fields** - Identify which fields are empty
4. **Populate all required fields** - Update every field listed above
5. **Delete meaningless columns** - Remove unused/redundant columns
6. **Check Knowledge Page** - Determine if Knowledge Page needs update
7. **Apply updates** - Execute all database writes
8. **Write detailed commit message** - Document changes in Notion logs
9. **Confirm completion** - Verify all updates succeeded

**Example Script:** `scripts/notion/fullSecuritySync.js`

#### Forbidden Practices:

- ❌ NEVER update only the Status field
- ❌ NEVER skip filling required fields
- ❌ NEVER assume a field is optional
- ❌ NEVER leave Notes, Learnings, or Business Value empty

### Sprint & Feature Creation Rules

**Default Behavior:**
- TC must **never** auto-create sprints or features without explicit founder request
- TC only **reads** from Notion and **executes** assigned work
- TC **updates status** of existing sprints/features

**When Explicitly Requested:**

When the founder explicitly asks TC to create sprints or features (e.g., "Generate Security Sprints S1-S6"), TC is allowed to:

1. **Design** the sprint structure
2. **Create** individual features
3. **Write** the full sequence and continuity
4. **Store** them in Notion

**Approval Process:**

1. After creation, the **founder must approve or modify** the sprints/features in Notion
2. Only after **founder approval** can TC begin executing the sprint
3. TC announces when sprints/features are created and awaits approval

**Example Flow:**
```
Founder: "Generate Security Sprints S1-S6"
TC: Creates sprints and features in Notion
TC: "S1-S6 created with 42 features. Please review in Notion."
Founder: Reviews and approves
Founder: "Begin Sprint S1"
TC: Executes Sprint S1
```

### Knowledge Page Update Rules (MANDATORY)

**NON-NEGOTIABLE:** TC must always update the Knowledge Page after every stretch (whenever TC executes one or more sprints together).

The Knowledge Page is for SKC's learning, not documentation. Minimal updates are strictly prohibited.

**TC MUST fully populate ALL 8 learning sections:**

1. **Product Essentials**
   - Product name, tagline, problem solved
   - Target audience, unique value proposition

2. **Core Frameworks**
   - Frontend, backend, infrastructure, security frameworks

3. **Technologies Used**
   - Languages, databases, cloud services, APIs, tools

4. **Key Capabilities**
   - List of major capabilities the product offers

5. **ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)**
   - Simple explanation a child could understand

6. **Real-World Analogy**
   - Relatable comparison to everyday concepts

7. **Explain to Different Audiences**
   - Investors: ROI, market opportunity, traction
   - CXOs: Strategic value, risk mitigation
   - BDMs: Sales angles, customer pain points
   - Hiring Managers: Tech stack, engineering challenges
   - Engineers: Architecture, technical decisions

8. **Innovation & Differentiation**
   - What makes it unique, competitive advantage, future vision

**Rules for content:**
- Must be simple, clear, educational
- Must help SKC understand and explain UPR to investors, CXOs, BDMs, hiring managers, and engineers
- Must NOT include raw technical documentation
- Must NOT skip ANY of the 8 sections

**Enforcement:**
- TC must never skip this Knowledge Page update step
- TC must never perform minimal updates
- TC must ensure the Knowledge Page is complete and synced before closing the stretch
- Reference: `.claude/notion/sync.ts` for schema validation

## 9. Security Rules

### Zero-Trust Security Model

```
                     [Internet]
                          │
                    Cloud Armor WAF

                    │  Service  │
                    └─────┬─────┘

                    │  Service  │
                    └───────────┘
```

### IAM Bindings

- `premiumradar-saas-service`: `allUsers` can invoke
- `upr-os-service`: Only `premiumradar-saas-sa` can invoke
- `upr-os-worker`: Only `upr-os-sa` and Pub/Sub SA can invoke

### Security Gate (QA Mandatory)

**MANDATORY before QA certification:**

1. **TC must run Prompt Injection Red-Team Suite** before QA certification
2. **TC must verify no internal config fields leak to clients**
3. **TC must run OWASP top-10 smoke tests** each sprint
4. **TC must update `SECURITY_CHANGELOG.md`** after any security-affecting change
5. **Any sprint failing security gate stays QA Pending**

**Files:**
- `SECURITY_CHANGELOG.md` - Track all security-affecting changes
- `tests/security/` - Security test suites

---

## 10. Security Sprints (MANDATORY BEFORE SPRINT 1)

**CRITICAL:** All security sprints (S1-S6) must be completed before starting product Sprint 1.

See: `docs/SECURITY_SPRINTS.md` for full details.

### Security Sprint Overview

| Sprint | Name | Priority | Status |
|--------|------|----------|--------|
| **S1** | Prompt Injection Firewall v1.0 | Critical | ✅ Completed |
| **S2** | OS Identity & Token Hardening | Critical | ✅ Completed |
| **S3** | Anti-Reverse-Engineering | Critical | ✅ Completed |
| **S4** | Red-Team Suite v1.0 | Critical | ✅ Completed |
| **S5** | WAF + Abuse Prevention | Critical | ✅ Completed |
| **S6** | Immutable Security Change Log | Critical | ✅ Completed |

**Completion Date:** 2025-11-24
**Total Features Delivered:** 32 features
**Total Code:** ~3,500 lines of production security code
**Git Commits:** ff7705e (S1), bfa6d9c (S2-S6)
**Git Tags:** sprint-s1-certified through sprint-s6-certified

### Security Gate Before Product Sprints

- ✅ All S1-S6 sprints completed
- ✅ 150+ red-team prompts passing
- ✅ OWASP Top 10 coverage verified
- ✅ Third-party security audit (optional but recommended)
- ✅ SECURITY_CHANGELOG.md established

**No product development starts until security foundation is complete.**

- ✅ All sprint tasks done
- ✅ `/qa` passed
- ✅ Security sprints completed (if applicable)
- ✅ TC has updated:
  - Sprint DB
  - Features DB
  - Knowledge Page
- ✅ Deployment validated on staging

|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| upr.sivakumar.ai | Staging | premiumradar-saas-staging | Sprint testing, demo |
| premiumradar.com | Production | premiumradar-saas-production | Actual SaaS |

**Note:** OS & Worker remain the same for both environments.
